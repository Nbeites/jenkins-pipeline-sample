wget https://github.com/wardviaene/jenkins-course/blob/master/scripts/install_jenkins.sh
	(or put the file via SFTP with filezilla and run it afterwards)

	OR wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nbeites/jenkins-pipeline-sample/main/jenkins-install-digitalOcean/install_jenkins.sh

bash install_jenkins.sh

After Install:
	- cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword (to check initial password for jenkins)
	- cat /var/jenkins_home/workspace (to see projects)



To stop and remove current jenkins container:
	Inside jenkins-docker folder write :
		- docker stop jenkins
		- docker rm jenkins
		- /var/jenkins_home (jenkins is still in the disk as a volume, just not as a container running)


To Install jenkins-docker in remote machine inside a docker container:

	- git clone https://github.com/wardviaene/jenkins-docker (this directory is present in nbeites repo (AND CORRECTED))
	
	(OR wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nbeites/jenkins-pipeline-sample/main/jenkins-docker-master/Dockerfile)
	
	- docker build -t jenkins-docker .
	- docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --name jenkins -d jenkins-docker
	- docker exec -it jenkins bash (-it is to open a terminal)

	Note : to be functional, docker ps command must run correctly, if it does, means that the docker ps
	is communicating with socket present in /var/run/docker.sock in the host machine

	Check socket: ls -ahl /var/run/docker.sock (this command can run inside container or in host machine (both have to have the socket))

		NOTE : THE 2 GROUPS MUST HAVE THE SAME GID (998 as in docker:x:998:)
		IMPORTANT NOTE: THERE ARE 2 GROUPS, THE HOST MACHINE DOCKER GROUP AND THE CONTAINER DOCKER GROUP
		EXAMPLE : host machine -> docker:x:998:root ; container -> docker:x:998:jenkins (THIS WORKS), just run the DockerFile that is 
		in this project in jenkins-docker

		If does not work, try executing the following command outside container : sudo systemctl restart docker
		And try again...

		If not resolves, then see what comes out of this command :
			- grep docker /etc/group (inside container)
				If it's like docker:x:998:
					- sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins (to add jenkins to docker group) (supposedly is already inside dockerfile)



					--------------

					Configure Pipeline : 

						- Repository URL to project Repository
						- Docker Build:
							- Create a empty Repository in docker hub and put it in docker build repository name
							- add creds: docker hub creds
					
					Download and Run container in repository in host machine:

					docker pull nbeites/nodejs-demo-example:latest
					docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name my-nodejs-app nbeites/nodejs-demo-example
